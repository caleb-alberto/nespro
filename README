======

  This is a small webserver project I made to learn about HTTP and servers in
  general. It is not meant to be production-level, but with some more effort it
  could be. The general structure includes forwarding unrecognized paths to a
  specified backend URL, TLS/SSL encryption with OpenSSL (if desired),
  multithreading for HTTP and HTTPS connections with a user-specified maximum
  number of connections, logging (found in "server_log.txt"), and basic webserver
  functionality.

BUILDING AND RUNNING the server:

  This project depends on the following libraries:
 - OpenSSL (-lcrypto and -lssl)
 - yaml-cpp (-lyaml-cpp)
 - cURL (-lcurl)

  Debian/Ubuntu:
    sudo apt install libssl-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
  macOS:
    brew install openssl yaml-cpp curl
  
  I will assume you know the equivalent install steps if you are on some other
  system.
  
  For compiling the server:
 - HTTPS:        make
 - HTTP:         make http
 - delete build: make clean
 
  To run the server after it's been built:
 ./server
 
CONFIGURING the server:

  The server contains a default configuration file called "config.yaml" where
  some default options are found. Some of these options are REQUIRED and the
  server will not compile/run properly without them properly chosen (mostly just
  max connections, port, and public folder). Certificate and private key file
  are only required if you build with SSL (default). The options include:
 - max connections:  max amount of current connections allowed at one moment
 - port:             port the server listens on
 - public folder:    folder including files which can be requested from a client
 - backend url:      URL the server forwards unrecognised path names too
 - certificate file: path to TLS/SSL certificate
 - private key file: path to TLS/SSL private key
